web browser - Comes with Python and opens a browser to a specific page
Requests - Downloads files and web pages from the Internet
Beautiful Soup - Parses HTML
Selenium - Launches and controls a web browser. Selenium is able to fill in forms and simulate mouse clicks in the browser

# This is what the program does:

- Gets a street address from the command line arguments or clipboard
- Opens the web browser to the Google Maps page for the address

This means that the code will need to do the following:
- Read from cmd arguments from sys.argv and
- Read what is in the clipboard 
- Call the webbrowser.open() function to open the web browser

The workflow of getting a map on Google without automation is this:
- Highlight the address
- Copy the address to the clipboard
- Open the web browser
- Go to https://www.google.com/
- Click the address text field
- Paste the address text
- Hit ENTER

The workflow of the automated version
- Highlight the address
- Copy the address to the clipboard
- Run scrape.py
